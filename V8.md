This engine consists, mainly, in two components:

The memory heap: where all memory allocation happens
The call stack: where our code gets framed and stacked to execute

The engine is just a tiny bit of what makes JavaScript, well... JavaScript... There are browser-provided APIs which we call Web APIs — or also, external APIs — these APIs (like DOM, AJAX and setTimeout) are provided by the browser vendors — in this case, for Chrome, it's Google — or by the runtime itself, like Node (with different APIs). And they are the main reason why most people hated (and still hate) JavaScript. When we look at today's JavaScript we see a field filled with packages and other stuff, but mostly homogeneous on every side. Well... It wasn't always like that.
